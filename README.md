# Fantasy Name Generator Site
A HTML and JavaScript site for generating fantasy names. It can be use for character names or user names or whatever you want.

It is possible to specify a type of name by universum, culture or sex.

# How to use

1. Choose how many names to generate. The default number 100 is OK.
2. Select one or more namesets. I recommend to select just one or two, because it gives the best control over generated names style.
3. Click the button to generate. In will be unclickable if no namesets is selected.
4. It is possible to sort the generated names alphabetically or by lenght in both directions.
